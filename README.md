# abcjs-soundfonts

Contains soundfonts for use in [abcjs](https://github.com/paulrosen/abcjs)

For now (and probably the time being) there is only one sound font called "FluidR3_Salamander_GM", which uses the default abcjs sound samples called "FluidR3_GM" taken from [here](https://github.com/paulrosen/midi-js-soundfonts). It is generated from [FluidR3_GM.sf2](https://member.keymusician.com/Member/FluidR3_GM/index.html) and published under the MIT license (see [license file](https://member.keymusician.com/Member/FluidR3_GM/README.html)).

The acoustic grand piano instrument samples however were replaced by the [Salamander Grand Piano](https://freepats.zenvoid.org/Piano/acoustic-grand-piano.html), authored by Alexander Holm in version V3+2020-06-02 which was originally published under the [Creative Commons Attribution 3.0](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/) license, but is now public domain.

*Description: Yamaha C5, recorded with two AKG c414 disposed in an AB position ~12cm above the strings, 48kHz 24bit, 16 velocity layers. Sampled in minor thirds from the lowest A. Hammer noise releases chromatically sampled in one layer. String resonance releases in minor thirds in three layers.*

The samples in this repository are authored from the 44.1kHz 16bit samples version hosted [here](https://freepats.zenvoid.org/Piano/acoustic-grand-piano.html).
